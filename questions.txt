QUESTIONS -------------------------------------------------------------------

- The service details modal slide-in animation is glitchy for some
services because of the size of the picture. Is there a good way to make
sure the animation is smooth regardless of the image size?

- Unless I use the server's base url (http://localhost:5173) and then
the image file path, the image doesn't populate on the service cards
during the service selection process.
